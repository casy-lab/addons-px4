# PX4 Addons
This repository contains addons files for the [PX4 Autopilot](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git).
In particular, the provided folders and files allow to mount vision sensors (monocular, stereo, and depth cameras) onboard the simulated Iris UAV. Moreover, we provide convenience scripts to simulate urban canyon environments.
